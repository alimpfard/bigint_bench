+ _A plot_
![#](./plot.png)

## Running it
```sh
$ make all #-> cleans, builds and runs all the tests, and generates a plot (node.js will take a long time)
$ make quick #-> everything but node
```
**Note: zsh's `time` is used for timing, and the format is as follows**
```
%J   %U  user %S system %P cpu %*E total'$'\n'
```
